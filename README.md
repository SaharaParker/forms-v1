Initial Commit
First I started with the index. HTML file and I typed in all of the doc class and div id tags. 
I then added the template tags and added a header and tried to add the typing effect. 
Then I went ahead and fixed any typos and removed the typing affect tag, since it didnâ€™t seem to make an effect. 
I entered an email label and continue button.
Continuing on with the Airbnb HTML, I inspected everything to see the basics of what I would need. 
I did this to avoid typing as much as I did in the index file. 
I figured for the most part I needed headers, labels, div class tags, select tags, and input tags. I also needed a couple of buttons.
Along the way of adding these tags and filling them out, I checked to make sure they were showing up in my web browser. 
After confirming they were visible, I made commits and then pushed them to github.
I added the rest of my buttons, I attempted to fix any errors and did my final save, commit, and push.
